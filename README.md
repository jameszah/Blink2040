  This basically blinks a 10x8 matrix of normal leds, using a rp2040, but lets you change the blink frequency,
  and add shapes, and sublimal text of regular text to the display.

  Currently is plays a 2 minute cycle with
  - subliminal text on first run after reboot
  - some sublimal images, ending in a quick look at it
  - some blank part of matrix,
  - some floating text followed by happy face
  - and some clear text at the end
  - potentiometer to change blink frequency
  - touch sensor to disable subliminal message and shapes and return to simple blink supercomputer
  - add code to run off a usb-powerbank to burn just enough current every 15 second cycle to keep the powerbank alive

  - change the patterns a little -- more faces, less beer
