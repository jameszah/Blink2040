 Blink2040

  Software version of the BigClive SuperComputer  
  
  (clink the image below to see a 90 second cycle from youtube  
  -- you can speed it up to get the entire 90 seconds as the patterns change)

  This basically blinks a 10x8 matrix of normal leds, using a rp2040, but lets you change the blink frequency,
  and add shapes, and sublimal text of regular text to the display.

  Currently is plays a 90 second cycle with
  - subliminal text on first run after reboot
  - some sublimal images, ending in a quick look at it
  - some blank part of matrix,
  - some floating text followed by happy face
  - and some clear text at the end

  Next step
  - add a potentiometer to change blink frequency
  - add a capacitive touch to disable subliminal message and shapes and return to simple blink supercomputer
